# Credit-Risk-Feature-Selection

This Python project delves into the implementation of feature selection techniques—Forward Selection and Backward Elimination—on a credit card default dataset. The goal is to identify and eliminate unnecessary features, enhancing the efficiency and performance of predictive models. The repository comprises a comprehensive Python script that guides users through the step-by-step application of these techniques on the dataset.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset provides insights into credit card clients, encompassing demographic details, credit data, payment history, and default payments. The target variable predicts whether a client will default on payment in the next month.

## Techniques Implemented
Forward Selection: The model iteratively adds variables based on their statistical significance, starting with none.

## Backward Elimination: 
The model iteratively removes variables based on their statistical significance, starting with all variables.

## How to Use
Download the Python script from the repository.
Replace the dataset path in the script with the path on your local machine.
Run the script to observe the results of the feature selection methods.
